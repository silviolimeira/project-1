Factory Design pattern - Properties

- Creational design pattern
- Used when we have multiple sub-classes of a Super class & based on
  input we want to return one class instance
- It provides abstraction between implementation & client classes
- Remove the instantiation of client classes from client code

Implementation

- Super class can be interface or abstract class or basic class
- Factory class has a static method which returns the instance of Sub-
  class based on input
